# Features of Taitris

### LeadGenerator
The `LeadGenerator` agent utilizes advanced AI algorithms to identify potential influencers who align with your brand's values and campaign goals. By analyzing vast amounts of data across social platforms, this agent pinpoints influencers who have the reach, demographic engagement, and content style that best match your target audience. This ensures a high-potential starting point for campaign engagements.

### OutreachSales
Once potential leads are identified, the `OutreachSales` agent takes over to initiate contact. This agent is equipped with capabilities to craft personalized outreach messages that are both engaging and reflective of your brand’s voice. Using natural language processing models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, `OutreachSales` efficiently handles initial communications, setting the stage for fruitful collaborations.

# How Taitris Works
Taitris seamlessly integrates these agents into a cohesive system that synchronizes each step of the campaign process. From lead generation through to final negotiations, each agent communicates and shares relevant data to maintain consistency and optimize outcomes. This synchronization not only saves time but also enhances the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, ensuring that each influencer relationship is maximized for best results.
